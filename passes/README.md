# Guard passes!
I will use this guide to document progress and list possible guard passes that I know/want to learn.

### Standing full guard break and pass:
#### Break:
From closed guard, one of your hands on the lapel, the other pins one of your opponent's hands 
by controlling their wrist. Keep your lapel hand kind of tucked into the valley of your knee and your
opponent's leg- just staying tight. Now, on the side that you are pinning your opponent, step your foot upnea
their hip, next step your other leg up too, but rotate your hips and immediately step backwards with this 
leg (or as soon as you can). You must take this backstep, otherwise your opp can grab this leg. Now release your lapel
grip and use that arm's forearm/elbow to remove your opp's leg from that side of your body.  
#### Pass:  
Now, on your side that you've removed your opp's leg, immediatly use your shin to 'staple' opp's leg to the floor.
Use this same side arm to get an underhook collar grip. With your other arm, grab under opp's other side thigh. Then, windshield
wiper your feet over the leg you have 'stapled', and -just like that- you've passed their guard!
